# TechnisatControl
Control your Technisat receiver via network

This small code snippet shows how a Technisat (or Technistar) receiver can be controlled via network. We simply use the Technisat Connect connection. With simple UDP packets you can send control-messages to control the receiver the same way as with the remote control.
This can be used e.g. in a smart home context.
